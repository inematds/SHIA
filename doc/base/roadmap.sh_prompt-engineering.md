Prompting Best Practices
— Provide few-shot examples for structure or output style you need
— Keep your prompts short and concise
— Prioritize giving clearer instructions over adding constraints
— Control the maximum output length
— Use variables / placeholders in your prompts for easier configuration
— Experiment with input formats and writing styles
— Tune sampling (temperature, top-k, top-p) for determinism vs creativity
— Guard against prompt injection; sanitize user text
— Automate evaluation; integrate unit tests for outputs
— Document and track prompt versions
— Optimize for latency & cost in production pipelines
— Document decisions, failures, and learnings for future devs
— Delimit different sections with triple backticks or XML tags
— Ask for structured output if it helps e.g. JSON, XML, Markdown, CSV etc
